# Preliminaries: Installing R and RStudio

## Introduction

The course makes extensive use of R and RStudio. Here are the instructions to install these two tools.

## Learning Objectives

In this reading, you will learn:

1. How to install R.
2. About the RStudio Interactive Development Environment.
3. About packages in R.

##	R: The Open Statistical Computing Project

### What is R?

R is an open-source language for statistical computing. It was created by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the University of Auckland, in New Zealand, as a way to offer their students an accessible, no-cost tool for their courses. R is now maintained by the R Development Core Team, and developed by hundreds of contributors around the globe. R is an attractive alternative to other software applications for data analysis (e.g., Microsoft Excel, STATA) due to its open-source character (i.e., it is free), its flexibility, and large and dedicated user community, which means if there’s something you want to do (for instance, linear regression), it is very likely that someone has already developed functionality for it in R.

A good way to think about R is as a core package, to which a library, consisting of additional packages, can be attached to increase its functionality. R can be downloaded for free at:

```
https://cran.rstudio.com/
```

R comes with a built-in console (a user graphical interface), but better alternatives to the basic interface exist, including RStudio, an Integrated Development Environment, or IDE for short. RStudio can also be downloaded for free, by visiting the website:

```

```

R requires you to work using the command line, which is going to be unfamiliar to many of you accustomed to user-friendly graphical interfaces. Do not fear. People worked for a long time using the command line, or even more cumbersome, punched cards in early computers. Graphical user interfaces are convenient, but they have a major drawback, namely their inflexibility. A program that functions based on graphical user interfaces allows you to do only what is hard-coded in the user interface. Command line, as we will see, is somewhat more involved, but provides much more flexibility in operation.

Go ahead. Install R and RStudio in your computer.

Before introducing some basic functionality in R, lets quickly take a tour R Studio.

###	The RStudio IDE

The RStudio IDE provides a complete interface to interact with the language R. It consists of a window with several panes. Some panes include in addition several tabs. There are the usual drop-down menus for common operations, such as creating new files, saving, common commands for editing, etc. See Figure \@ref(fig:RStudio-IDE) below.

```{r RStudio-IDE, fig.cap= "\\label{fig:RStudio-IDE}The RStudio IDE", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("00-Figure-1.png"))
```

The editor pane allows you to open and work with text and other files, where you can write instructions that can be passed on to the program. Writing something in the editor does not execute any instructions, it merely records them for possible future use. In fact, much of what is written in the editor will not be instructions, but rather comments, discussion, and other text that is useful to understand code.

The console pane is where instructions are passed on to the program. When an instruction is typed (or copied and pasted) there, R will understand that it needs to do something. The instructions must be written in a way that R understands, otherwise errors will occur. If you have typed instructions in the editor, you can use "ctrl-Enter" (in Windows) or "cmd-Enter" (in Mac) to send to the console and execute.

The environment is where all data that is currently in memory is reported. The History tab acts like a log: it keeps track of the instructions that have been executed in the console.

The last pane includes a number of useful tabs. The File tab allows you to navigate your computer, change the working directory, see what files are where, and so on. The Plot tab is where plots are rendered, when instructions require R to do so. The Packages tab allows you to manage packages, which as mentioned above, are pieces of code that can augment the functionality of R. The Help tab is where you can consult the documentation for functions/packages/see examples, and so on. The Viewer tab is for displaying local web content, for instance, to preview a Notebook (more on Notebooks soon).

This brief introduction should have allowed you to install both R and RStudio. The next thing that you will need is _packages_.

## Packages in R

Packages are the basic units of reproducible code in the R multiverse. Packages allow a developer to create a self-contained unit of code that often is meant to achieve some task. For instance, there are packages in R that specialize in statistical techniques, such as [cluster analysis](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cluster/index.html), [visualization](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/index.html), or [data manipulation](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/). Some packages can be miscellaneous tools, or contain mostly datasets. Packages are a very convenient way of maintaining code, data, and documentation, and also of sharing all these resources.

Packages can be obtained from different sources (including making them!). One of the reasons why R has become so successful is the relative facility with which packages can be distributed. A package that I use frequently is called `tidyverse`. The `tidyverse` is a collection of functions for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization. This package can be downloaded and installed in your personal library of R packages by using the function `install.packages`, as follows:
```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

The function `install.packages` retrieves packages from the [Comprehensive R Archive Network](https://cran.r-project.org/), or CRAN for short. CRAN is a collection of sites (accessible via the internet) that carry identical materials for distribution for R.
